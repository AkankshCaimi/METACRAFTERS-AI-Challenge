            "CONTEXT: Those anomalies could be cloaked ships. O'BRIEN: Could be, sir. PICARD: Open a channel to the Excalibur. RIKER [OC]: Excalibur, Riker here. PICARD: Deploy the fleet, Will. It's time to spread our net. RIKER [OC]: Yes, sir. [Sutherland Bridge] HOBSON: We've arrived at the designated coordinates, Captain. DATA: All stop. Notify the flagship that we have assumed station. HOBSON: Starboard power coupling has overloaded. We've got a radiation leak on decks ten through twelve. DATA: Why are the backups not functioning? HOBSON: There wasn't enough time to test all the backups before we left the yard. Terry, I want you down in Engineering working on a new coupling. DATA: You have taken the phaser and torpedo control units offline. HOBSON: Keith, you and I will start bringing the radiation DATA: Mister Hobson, it is inappropriate for you to determine a course of action without consulting the commanding officer. HOBSON: I was trying to safeguard the lives of people on those decks, but you're right. Belay those orders, everyone. Phasers and torpedoes are back online. What should we do, sir? DATA: You will take the phasers and torpedo units offline and begin repairs of the starboard power coupling. HOBSON: Thank you, sir. You heard the Captain, everyone. [Bridge] RIKER [on monitor]: We're ready, sir. PICARD: Mister La Forge, how long do you think it will take the Romulans to detect the tachyon field once it's activated? LAFORGE [on monitor]: Not long Romulan sensors are as good as ours. PICARD: Very well. Energise the network. [Romulan command centre] MOVAR: There's an increase in tachyon emissions from the Federation fleet. SELA: They're using the beams as a detection field. MOVAR: If we try to cross it, they'll see us, even if we're cloaked. SELA: Issue orders to begin work on a way to penetrate this field. In the meantime, we'll have to convince Captain Picard he should leave. [Bridge] O'BRIEN: Captain, I'm picking up something directly ahead. Romulan ship decloaking. Shall I raise shields? PICARD: Not yet. O'BRIEN: They're hailing us, sir. PICARD: On screen. Tasha? SELA [on viewscreen]: No, Captain. I am Commander Sela. The woman you knew as Tasha Yar was my mother. Deploying an invasion fleet along our border is a clear act of aggression, Captain. It will not be tolerated. You have twenty hours to recall your ships and return peacefully to Federation territory. [Observation lounge] PICARD: So you believe her, Counsellor? TROI: I'm not saying we should accept her claim at face value, but I sensed no deception from her. She really believes she is the daughter of Tasha Yar. CRUSHER: Regardless of what she believes, Sela can't be her daughter. I've reviewed all of Tasha's medical records, and there is no indication that she was ever pregnant. PICARD: Besides, Tasha was a child when this woman was born. TROI: Sela could have been cloned. CRUSHER: Or had her appearance surgically altered. PICARD: But why? What possible advantage could there be to the Romulans? As this now stands, I don't think this will have any impact on our strategy. We'll continue the blockade, leave the next move to them. Thank you. (Beverly and Deanna leave, then Guinan enters) GUINAN: Am I intruding? PICARD: No, not at all. Is something wrong? GUINAN: News travels fast. I heard that Tasha Yar's daughter is aboard the Romulan ship. PICARD: I think that the Romulans are just hoping to create a distraction. They want to keep us off balance. GUINAN: How much do you know about what happened to the last ship called Enterprise? PICARD: Enterprise C? She was lost at the battle of Narendra Three, defending a Klingon outpost from the Romulans. GUINAN: And the survivors? PICARD: There were stories of prisoners taken back to Romulus, but these were only rumours. GUINAN: No. There were survivors. And Tasha Yar was one of them. PICARD: Guinan, that was twenty three years ago. Tasha Yar was only a child. GUINAN: I know that. But I also know she was aboard that ship and she was not a child. And I think you sent her there. PICARD: How can that be? GUINAN: I don't know. I just know that you did. PICARD: Tasha died, a year before you came on the Enterprise. You never met her. GUINAN: I know that. PICARD: If you have only a vague intuition GUINAN: You can't just dismiss this. If I'm right, then you are responsible for this whole situation. PICARD: I think that it's time I met Commander Sela. [Klingon bar] WORF: We are at war. Gowron should forbid any challenges until we are victorious. KURN: A Klingon does not postpone a matter of honour. WORF: A Klingon should place the good of the Empire above his own pride. KURN: So now Gowron no longer suits you. Perhaps you mean to challenge him for the leadership of the Council? WORF: No. KURN: Then do not speak of this again! I did not wish to follow Gowron. You came to me and insisted we support Gowron against the Duras family. The time for debate is over. We are Klingons. He is our leader. If that is not enough for you, then perhaps you made the wrong choice when you put on that uniform. (Kurn leaves, and two Klingons attack Worf, knocking him out and dragging him away) [Observation lounge] SELA: Well, Captain, what is this urgent matter we need to discuss? PICARD: Please, won't you sit down? (she folds her arms and remains standing) PICARD: I'm afraid that you have misinterpreted our presence here. I want to reassure you that we have no hostile intention. SELA: Ah. Then I can tell my superiors that a fleet of twenty three Federation starships is on our border for, what, humanitarian reasons? PICARD: It is our intent to prevent any external power from interfering in Klingon affairs. SELA: Nor do we have any plan to do so. But Captain, if for any reason we chose to enter Klingon territory, how would you\n",
